# El Camino de la Ballena Digitalization Project

![Book Cover](/portada.jpg)

## Overview

Welcome to the "El camino de la ballena" Digitalization Project. This project aims to preserve and bring to life a cherished literary work that is no longer in publication due to disagreements among the heirs and issues related to the rights. My goal is to digitize this book for use in an interactive game, create an audiobook, and make it accessible to a wider audience in the digital age.

## Project Status

### Current Progress

- **Digitization**: I am currently in the process of converting the physical copy of the book into a digital format. This involves scanning, transcribing, and formatting the text.
- **Game Integration**: Initial planning stages for integrating the book's content into an interactive game.
- **Audiobook**: Plans are underway to produce an audiobook version, which will be narrated and made available for listeners.

### Future Plans

- **Complete Digitization**: Finish the transcription and formatting of the entire book.
- **Interactive Game**: Develop a game that incorporates the book's narrative and characters.
- **Audiobook Release**: Record and release the audiobook version of El Camino de la Ballena.
- **Additional Formats**: Explore other digital formats to ensure the book reaches as many people as possible.

## Why This Project?

The decision to digitize "El Camino de la Ballena" stems from the importance of preserving its literary value and making it accessible despite the publication issues. By transforming the book into a digital format and integrating it into a game, we can introduce it to new audiences and ensure its legacy continues.
